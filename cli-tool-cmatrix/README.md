cmatrix is a fun command-line utility that creates the iconic "digital rain" effect from The Matrix movies, displaying a continuous stream of falling green characters in the terminal, primarily used for aesthetic, visual flair, as a screensaver (with the -s flag), or just as a cool, nostalgic tribute to the film. 

```
docker build -t cmatrix-rajesh .
docker run -it --name cmatrix-rajesh cmatrix-rajesh
```
